# Anti-cheat-Writeup
Personal research on anti-cheats. Please use this information responsibly. This information is not complete yet, I intend to keep adding to it as time goes on. You can start reading from [table of contents](src/TableOfContents.md). You will also find a logbook of my day to day findings in the table of contents. Those are unstructured day to day logbooks. As I get more information and knowledge I will structure them in the correct chapters in the table of contents. Feel free to correct me if I make any mistakes, I am just a student learning.

Updates and work may be delayed as I am entering exam season. Work should continue as soon as exams are over
