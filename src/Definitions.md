## Anti-Cheat
According to Wikipedia:

*"Anti-cheat software is designed to prevent players of online games from gaining unfair advantage through the use of third-party tools, usually taking the form of software hooks. It is challenged to run securely in an aggressively hostile environment.<sup>[[1]](#sources)</sup>"*

But I think there is more to an anti-cheat than just preventing. Anti-cheat software also does extensive logging and analysis<sup>[[2]](#sources)</sup>, as well as banning users via Hardware ID (HWID) bans<sup>[[3]](#sources)</sup>. They also collect and send code that they believe to be cheats for later anlysis to try and discover new methods<sup>[[4]](#sources)</sup> of catching cheaters.

## Cheating Software
*"Cheating in video games involves a video game player using various methods to create an advantage beyond normal gameplay...<sup>[[5]](#sources)</sup>"*

I fully agree with this statement. Cheats are used to get advantages in a variety of ways; from bots, to aimbots, all the way to account/item farming and everything in-between. 

## Global Security Cookie 
When entering a overrun protected function, a stack cookie gets created. Imagine a stack cookie like a wall for a buffer. If someone tried to overflow the buffer, the stack cookie will be modified (as it is placed right after the buffer in memory). The application then exits if it detects a breach in the wall, meaning the stack cookie was overwritten.
